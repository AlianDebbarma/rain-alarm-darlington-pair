# 🌧️ Rain Alarm using Darlington Transistor Pair

This project is a simple and effective **Rain Alarm System** built using a **Darlington Transistor Pair** for signal amplification. The system detects water droplets (rain) and triggers a buzzer or LED alert.

## 🔧 Components Used

- 2 × NPN Transistors (e.g., BC547 or BC557)
- 1 × Buzzer or LED (as alert)
- 1 × Resistor (1kΩ)
- 1 × Rain Sensor (or aluminum strip/metal plate setup)
- 1 × Breadboard
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply (5V or 9V)

## ⚙️ Working Principle

A **Darlington Pair** is used to amplify the small current produced when raindrops make contact with the sensor (metal strips or rain module). This amplified current drives the buzzer or LED.

**How it works:**
1. Rainwater completes the path between two conductive plates.
2. A small current flows, triggering the first transistor.
3. The second transistor in the Darlington pair amplifies it further.
4. Output device (LED/Buzzer) is activated.
